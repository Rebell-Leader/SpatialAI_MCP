import scanpy as sc
import squidpy as sq
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pathlib import Path

# Use consistent parameter validation
def validate_spatial_data(adata):
    """Validate spatial transcriptomics data structure."""
    required_keys = ['spatial', 'X_spatial']
    missing_keys = [k for k in required_keys if k not in adata.obsm]
    if missing_keys:
        raise ValueError(f"Missing required spatial keys: {missing_keys}")
    return True
```

**Nextflow DSL2 Workflows:**
```nextflow
// Follow OpenProblems conventions for spatial workflows
process SPATIAL_QUALITY_CONTROL {
    tag "$sample_id"
    publishDir "${params.outdir}/qc", mode: 'copy'

    input:
    tuple val(sample_id), path(spatial_data)

    output:
    tuple val(sample_id), path("${sample_id}_qc.h5ad"), emit: qc_data
    path "${sample_id}_qc_metrics.json", emit: metrics

    script:
    """
    python ${moduleDir}/scripts/spatial_qc.py \\
        --input ${spatial_data} \\
        --output ${sample_id}_qc.h5ad \\
        --metrics ${sample_id}_qc_metrics.json \\
